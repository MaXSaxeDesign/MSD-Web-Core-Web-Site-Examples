# MaX Saxe Design Web Core Web Site Examples

A selection of MaX Saxe Design Web Core web site examples.

Source authoring is a little different in this system.

> A few of the web sites will be source authored in HTML

> Some of the web sites will be source authored in HHVM & PHP

> Most of the web sites will be source authored in PHP

> A few of the web sites will be source authored in SHTML

All application web sites will include the index page & the includes folder

The standard for MaX Saxe Design Web Core hosted web sites is to have an includes subdomain, which can run as a virtual server within Nginx or run on a seperate server which is firewalled off from external IP address access.

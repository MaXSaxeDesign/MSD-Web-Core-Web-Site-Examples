## MEAN

### MEAN = Mongo DB, Express.js, Angular.js and Node.js

> Mongo DB is the, ever growing in popularity, NoSQL database.

> Express.js is the JavaScript communication handler for transferring data between the client and the server in both directions of data flow.

> Angular.js is the JavaScript framework running on the client JavaScript engine within the browser.

> Node.js is the JavaScript engine running on the web server.

### MERN = Mongo DB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js

> Mongo DB is the, ever growing in popularity, NoSQL database.

> Express.js is the JavaScript communication handler for transferring data between the client and the server in both directions of data flow.

> React.js is the JavaScript framework running on the client JavaScript engine within the browser.

## MEAN OR MERN - That is the Question

MaX Saxe Design [MSD] uses both MEAN and MERN in a multitude of projects.

Some projects are optimised by some of the feautres in Google's Angular.js framework, other projects are optimised by some of the features in React.js framework.

MSD does have projects that use a very odd custom implementation based on Angular.js, but with eleements from React.js.
